Text based multiplayer game as one of the projects I include here.
Technologies: PHP, MySQL, Javascript, AJAX and jQuery.
I bought a domain in the past and tried-tested this game with my friends. It is based on an old game we used to play with a piece of paper which we used to write a few lines of text, fold it and let only a small portion of the last sentence to be shown to the next player. The outcome was always hilarious.

I developed this page for fun. The original purpose was to create some games to play and share with my friends.
